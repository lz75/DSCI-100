    "</p> First played on grass courts by Victorian gentlemen and ladies in Britain, the origins of tennis can be traced back to a 13th-century French handball game called jeu de paume (“game of the palm”). Now played by millions of people around the world, tennis poses two players (singles) or pairs of players (doubles), who use rackets to hit a ball and bounce it over a net on a rectangular court. Points are awarded to a player or team whenever the opponent fails to correctly return the ball within the prescribed dimensions of the court. </p>"

    "<p> Upon initial inspection of the source data, we noticed that it was not in a tidy format and that several formatting inconsistencies were present. As a result, we believe that some cleaning and tidying of the data is required before conducting our analysis. For starters, we noticed a player's highest rank and the date on which they achieved this rank was recorded together under a single observation in the variable *Best Rank*. This issue of recording multiple observations together in a single data cell is a recurring theme throughout our source data. Therefore, our first approach to tidying this data set would be to create new columns and separate all instances of these groupings. Additionally, we aim to standardize many of the variables in order to facilitate predictive modelling. </p>\n"

While most players nowadays have a two-handed backhand, the sport of tennis was traditionally played only with a one handed backhand style. Moreover, since the two-handed style is a relatively recent development, we can assume that it is more common for an older player to possess a one-handed backhand. In addition to age being a factor, a player’s country of origin, or where they learned to play tennis, probably has a significant role in their playstyle and furthermore their choice of backhand. </p>"
